1. How about ordered lists?

  1. More levels, multiple lines of properly indented text
     such as this.
  2. More levels, multiple lines of properly indented text
     such as this.
  3. More levels, multiple lines of properly indented text
     such as this.
3. should also work well (but indents should be three spaces per level)
   1. More levels, multiple lines of properly indented text

> "The best founders work on *things that seem small but they move really
  quickly*. Every time you talk to the best founders they’ve gotten new things
  done. In fact, this is the one thing that we learned best predicts a success
  of founders in YC. If every time we talk to a team they’ve gotten new things
  done, that’s the best predictor we have that a company will be successful."
