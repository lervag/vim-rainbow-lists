INTRODUCTION                                                     *rblist-intro*

This is a Vim plugin to apply nested highlighting of lists. There are three
commands with related mappings; the names should speak for themselves:

  *<plug>(rblist-enable)*    *:RBListEnable*
  *<plug>(rblist-disable)*   *:RBListDisable*
  *<plug>(rblist-toggle)*    *:RBListToggle*

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                   *rblist-config*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONS                                                    *rblist-config-opts*

*g:rblist_levels*
  Set number of desired list levels to recognize.

  Default: 4

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGHLIGHT GROUPS                                      *rblist-config-highlight*

The number of available list levels is specified with |g:rblist_levels|. To
use more than the default number of levels (four), one must define the extra
colors. And of course, the default colors can be changed.

You can specify different colors for the various list levels. There are three
lists types recognized:

  `RBListsOi`    Ordered list
  `RBListsUi`    Unordered list
  `RBListsQi`    Quote

Here `i` represents a number from 0 up to |g:rblist_levels| - 1.

The highlighting groups of `RBListsU` and `RBListsQ` are linked to `RBListsO`,
so to change all of the default colors, you can simply change the `RBListsO`
groups. For example, you can do this: >

  :highlight RBListsO0 guifg=#FF0000
  :highlight RBListsO1 guifg=#00FF00
  :highlight RBListsO2 guifg=#0000FF
  :highlight RBListsO3 guifg=#FF00FF
  :highlight RBListsO4 guifg=#00FFFF
  :...

The item markers/bullets/numbers are also specifically highlighted with the
groups `RBListsBi`, these can be changed with e.g. >

  :highlight RBListsB0 guibg=#FF0000
  :highlight RBListsB1 guibg=#00FF00
  :highlight RBListsB2 guibg=#0000FF
  :highlight RBListsB3 guibg=#FF00FF
  :highlight RBListsB4 guibg=#00FFFF
  :...
